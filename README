Simple ESP8266 relay program - will turn on and off a relay at GPIO every TIMER milliseconds.

Developed for use with a SRD-05VDC-SL-C relay module board, using a simple N-P-N transistor and 5k1 resistor:

                  collector 5V --- relay +ve
                           / 
GPIO2 --- 5k1 --- base ---|
                           \
                            relay switch
                                 |
                                gnd --- relay -ve
